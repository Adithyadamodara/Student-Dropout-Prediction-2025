🎓 Student Dropout Analysis for School Education
📌 Problem Statement
Develop a Machine Learning model to identify early patterns and predict student dropout risks in the school education system.
________________________________________
📘 Overview
High dropout rates pose a major challenge to educational institutions and policymakers. By leveraging ML techniques such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, or XGBoost, this project aims to detect at-risk students early based on their academic, behavioral, and socio-economic indicators.
The final goal is to provide a predictive framework that helps educators intervene before a student permanently leaves school.
